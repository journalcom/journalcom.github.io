                <p>Lately, I've been thinking a lot about gratification. It is easy to get caught up in proving yourself to others, to yourself and to some imaginary person that never really exists. Sometimes, I spend so much time chasing the next goal, the next challenge, the next thing that will finally make me feel like I’ve made it. But the truth is, I've never made it.</p>
                
                <p>I’m starting to realize that real confidence isn’t about being ahead of anyone else. It’s about knowing that, even if you stood still, you’d still be enough.</p>
                
                <p>Came across a poem recently that put into words what I've been trying to understand for so long:</p>
                
                <div class="poem">
As long as you try
to impress others,
you are not convinced
of your own strength.

As long as you strive
to be better than others,
you are doubting your
own worth.

As long as you try
to elevate yourself
by lowering others,
you are doubting your
own greatness.

Who is in peace with oneself
doesn’t have to prove anything
to others.

Who knows one’s own worth
doesn’t need validation.

Who knows about one’s own greatness
lets others keep theirs.
