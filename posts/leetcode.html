                <p>good news is that all my entrance examinations are finally over.</p>

                <p>bad news is that i have absolutely no idea what to do.</p>

                <p>like literally nothing.</p>

                <p>maybe binge watching a few movies would work in for the short term but what about the long term?</p>

                <p>I wanted to do something meaningful that would benefit me later. So based on advice from college seniors, i decided to solve leetcode DSA problems since most 1st year CS courses include DSA.</p>

                <p>so I set out on a mission to figure out what leetcode is.</p>

                <p>to summarize: leetcode is basically a interview-prep platform to help you advance your coding skills and knowledge about computer algorithms.</p>

                <p>its mostly used for interview preparation.</p>

                <p>if you are a CS student looking for a head start on your first/second year uni courses, i will cut to the chase for you:</p>

                <p>instead scrolling endless subreddits for answers, trust me and just do the 
                    <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/the-leetcode-beginners-guide/" target="_blank">
                        intro to leetcode course
                    </a>,
                    it gives you a basic idea of what leetcode is and how to use it.
                </p>

                <p>personally, I found the problems to be very logical; easy tagged questions ~ moderate difficulty atleast for me. It is doable with high school coding knowledge.</p>

                <p>if you start leetcode now, your future you will thank you.</p>
