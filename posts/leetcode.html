                today i will talk about how i created this website, nothing else.

                <div class="entry-date">March 30 2025</div>
                been a day since my last school exam finished, and now I sat back on my chair thinking what I would do now.
                Thought about getting a guitar, but that was too far-fetched since I wouldn't have the time to learn guitar in college.
                so i decided to work on a journal which I had been putting off since a month.

                FYI I had always wanted to create an online journal, in fact I did create one on Notion in 2023, which died out pretty quickly cause I didn't feel a spark. Hopefully this lasts. :O

                <img src="../images/old-journal.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my previous Notion journal" class="journal-image">
                <div class="caption">My abandoned 2023 Notion journal</div>

                So I set out to create a custom journal from scratch.
                I planned to learn HTML, CSS, MD, and JS for creating the website, but I was too lazy. (So I just ChatGPT-ed instead.)

                <div class="entry-date">April 01 2025</div>
                After 2 days of coding, testing designs, passwords(this part troubled me the most), endless black screens, setting easter eggs and HTML structures, I finally finished this site today.

                shoutout to Atharva Kokane's online journal which inspired me to build this. <a href="https://atharvakokane.github.io/" target="_blank">https://atharvakokane.github.io/</a>
                also shoutout to ChatGPT and DeepSeek for convincing me that CS is dead ðŸ˜­.
